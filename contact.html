    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <img src="/personal_website/Media/profshot.jpg" height="500px" class="img">

    <p class="abt">
        My name is Isaiah Martinez and I am an undergraduate studying Computer Science and Mathematics at CSUN.
        I am interested in the theoretical aspects of Computer Science and Mathematics involving:
        time complexity, graph theory, and the analytical, proof-making process.
        I enjoy making mini-projects and learning new things whilst applying what I have learned in addition to what I know to complete them.
        I think that the most challenging thing for me is to find the time to balance my interests, work, and personal relationships.
        Overall, I enjoy learning new things and applying them to situations that will hopefully make others lives easier.
        As such, I'm very comfortable with trying new things and often seek to expand the limits of my understanding; even beyond my fields of interest.
        This extends beyond my academic studies, but also my hobbies, personal relationships, in addition to my very view on life.
        My goal in life is simple:
    </p>
    <p>
        To be happy, and bring happiness to others.
    </p>
    <br>

    <p class="abt">
        In addition to being a computer scientist, I am a musician. 
        I am primarily a bass player and have played in 3 bands previously: an alternative band named 'Rice and Beans', an unnamed jazz band, and an alternative band named 'Phantom Language'.
        I am currently band-less and have no plans to join a band, but I do enjoy playing and making music in my free time.
    </p>

        To address the elephant in the room, yes I have a fantastic red mohawk. I have had a mohawk since I was around 8 years old, and intend to keep it until I feel a style change is necessary in my life.
        Also, just because I have a mohawk doesn't necessitate that I like metal music. Although I do enjoy metal, correlation does not prove causation!
        In addition, I have 2 cats that I love very much. 
        Their names are Honey and Luna. (see images below).
        I am very much a cat person, but I do love most animals. I especially like any type of feline (lions, pumas, etc.), any ape/monkey (gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan, etc.), sharks, sloths, and penguins.
    </p>

    <p class="abt">
        In my free time I enjoy practicing martial arts, playing/making music, listening to music, coding, playing board/tabletop/video games, and reading manga, manhwa, and books. I'm not much of a movie/show guy, but I will watch them occasionally.
        <br>
        Recently (Summer 2022) I finally saw all of the Star Wars movies and can definitively say that yes although I like both Star Wars and Star Trek... <strong>Star Trek</strong> is better.
    </p>

    <ul class="aboutlist">
        
        <li><p>Some of my favorite <strong>manga/anime</strong> are: Naruto Shippuden, Anohana (yes I cried), Rurouni Kenshin, Great Teacher Onizuka, Mob Psycho 100, and Sweetness and Lightning (I cried even harder at this one. I definitely recommend it 100%)</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Some of my favorite <strong>books</strong> are: 1984 by George Orwell, Animal Farm by George Orwell, The Time Machine by H.G. Wells, The Illustrated man by Ray Bradbury, and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury.</p></li>
        
        <li>

                Some of my favorite <strong>video games</strong> are: Dishonored, Elden Ring, League of Legends, Civilation 6, Bloons Tower Defense 6, Resident Evil 2 (Remastered), and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
                <br>
                I like RPG's, JRPG's, and action games the best. For me nothing beats a great story and compelling gameplay alongside some strategy.
