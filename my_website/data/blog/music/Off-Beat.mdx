I think that having off-beat sounds are super difficult to pull off in most genres.
But when they're done correctly, it is truly a wonderful experience.
I talk about this because I recently came across a song by Denzel Curry called _Troubles_ ft. T-Pain.
I just love the small pause he takes before saying the next part of the line:

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center' }}>
  “We might struggle because life’s a <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> bitch.”
</div>

It's just so catchy and fun to say.
It also flows really well into the rest of the song.

Many songs utilize this sort of effect, but this is the one that I can recall most recently being so effective.
