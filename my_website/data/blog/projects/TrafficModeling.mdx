summary: 3D Traffic Modeling in Unity
---

# Description 

This project was a project where we wanted to obtain Real Time Traffic data to create a scene in Unity that would reflect the traffic data.
It has cars that move in the scene, and allows users to select a start and end destination.
It utilizes TomTom API to obtain the traffic data, which is then loaded into Unity manually for a couple of scenes.

My portion was focused on finding a source of the data and exporting that data in a useful format for our other members to use.
