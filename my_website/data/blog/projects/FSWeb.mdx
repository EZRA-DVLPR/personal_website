# Description

This project is a website that utilizes the MERN stack to provide a service.
We hoped to create a website that allowed for users to upload and download files which would be stored on the server and within a database.
We succeeded in this creating this website with full functionality.

I set up the template to be used for the entire project, but my main focus was the frontend.
In the end I ended being the one who developed both fronted and backend, however.
