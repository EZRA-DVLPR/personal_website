# Description

First Blog Post on the new website!

This was my first time using an external hosting site [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
I was worried that exporting the project would be challenging since I've only worked with static websites in HTML, CSS, and JS without a powerful framework.
Luckily, it was mainly just accessibility options that proved to be challenging.


Hooray!
