# Description 

Contents: 
- Import txt files and parse through retrieving the filepath that exists in both as well as frames that correspond to the matching path
- Import txt files and parse through retrieving parts of data from the files and filenames themselves to add to either a DB or a CSV file
- Import txt files and parse through retrieving information from the files as well as the filenames. Connects to DB to extract thumbnails from given video, outputs XLS, and uploads thumbnails to Frame.io if the new XLS output is selected. All previous projects also function as expected
