# Description

This project consists of a series of 5 parts:

- Assignment 1 : Comparison of different disciplines within Data Science
- Assignment 2 : Read a CSV of data, and do basic operations on the data.
- Assignment 3 : Answer a series of questions regarding Data Mining.
- Assignment 4 : Perform Apriori function in R on a given dataset.
- Group Project : Music Recommendation Service

# Design

The initial design was to utilize Web Crawlers to obtain music data from a variety of sources.
I utilized a technique called Snowballing to obtain related artists from this website: [Music Map](https://www.music-map.com/).
From there, I took the artists and queried them on [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/) to obtain song data.

However when it came time to use the data, we lacked the user data that we desired to make a recommender system.
As such, we found an alternative source using Music Brainz Server's.
