Went to Big Bear with the Crew.
Had a great time going out to see the snow, hang out with friends, and chill.
I love the drive too.
I really enjoy driving and the bends are super fun.
The weather was wayyy better this time than last time.
Last time we saw just about every weather type / natural disaster possible:

- Earthquake
- Hail
- Snow
- Landslide
- Thunderstorm
- Rainstorm
- Fire

Also went to KBBQ since adobo was still here in the valley for a bit.
Got to see some other friends from the car group and that was awesome.
