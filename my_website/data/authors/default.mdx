# Elevator Pitch
My name is Isaiah Martinez, and I am a graduate student studying Computer Science at CSUN.
I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics in Spring 2023.
My interests include algorithm design and analysis, graph theory, combinatorics, proofs, and research.

I am a lifelong student.
There is always something new to learn, and I am happy to be a part of it.
I often construct new mini-projects and learn new skills beyond coding.
As such, I am very comfortable with trying new things and often seek to expand the limits of my understanding, even beyond my fields of interest.
This extends beyond my academic studies to my hobbies, personal relationships, and my view on life.

# More about me

I have had a mohawk since I was around 8 years old.
It was inspired by Mr. T from _The A-Team_ and Mario Balotelli from the Italian Soccer Team.
I've tried many colors, such as platinum, blue, green, and purple, but red remains the one I'm most comfortable with.
It's also the color most people remember me by, as I've had red for around six years consistently.

In addition, I have two cats that I love very much. Their names are Honey and Luna. I love most animals, especially felines (lions, pumas, etc.), apes/monkeys (gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, etc.), sharks, sloths, and penguins.

## Music

In addition to being a computer scientist, I am a musician.
I am a bass player and have played in three bands previously: an alternative band named Rice and Beans, an unnamed jazz band, and an alternative band named Phantom Language.
I am currently not in a band and have no plans to join one.
However, I still enjoy playing and writing music.

## Dexed

One tool that I utilize for fun is Dexed.
It's a synthesizer plugin that has a ton of variety.
Check it out by going to the developer's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed) or [website](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/).

### Musical Interests

Some of my favorite music genres are Alternative, Rock, Metal, Bluegrass, Reggaeton, Rap, Orchestral (Western Classical), Electronic, Disco, Oldies, Electronica, and K-pop.

Some of my favorite music artists/bands are _MUSE_, _Red Hot Chili Peppers_, _Tool_, _Ghost_, _(G)I-DLE_, _Bad Bunny_, _Daddy Yankee_, _Guaynaa_, _Eminem_, _Kendrick Lamar_, _Tupac_, _K.A.A.N._, _ABBA_, _Audioslave_, _Metallica_, _Villagers of Ioannina City_, and more.

## Martial Arts

In my free time, I enjoy practicing martial arts, playing/making music, listening to music, coding, playing board/tabletop/video games, and reading manga, manhwa, and books.
I'm not much of a movie/show guy, but I will watch them occasionally.
Recently (Summer 2022), I finally saw all of the Star Wars movies and can definitively say that although I like both Star Wars and Star Trek... I like Star Trek better.

## Anime

Some of my favorite manga/anime are _Naruto Shippuden_, _Anohana_, _Rurouni Kenshin_, _Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO)_, _Mob Psycho 100_, and _Sweetness and Lightning_.

## Books

Some of my favorite books are _1984_ by George Orwell, _Animal Farm_ by George Orwell, _The Time Machine_ by H.G. Wells, _The Illustrated Man_ by Ray Bradbury, and _Fahrenheit 451_ by Ray Bradbury.

## Video Games

Some of my favorite video games are _Dishonored_, _Elden Ring_, _League of Legends_, _Civilization VI_, _Bloons Tower Defense 6_, _Resident Evil 2 (Remastered)_, and _The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild_.
I like RPGs, JRPGs, and action games the best.
For me, nothing beats a great story, compelling gameplay, and strategy.
