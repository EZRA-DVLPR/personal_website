My name is Isaiah Martinez and I am an graduate student studying Computer Science at CSUN.
I obtained my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics in Spring 2023.
I am interested in the theoretical aspects of Computer Science and Mathematics involving: algorithm design and analysis, graph theory, and proofs.
I enjoy making mini-projects and learning new things whilst applying what I already know to complete them.
I think that the most challenging thing for me is to find the time to balance my interests, work, and personal relationships.

Overall, I enjoy learning new things and applying them to situations that will hopefully make others lives easier.
As such, I'm very comfortable with trying new things and often seek to expand the limits of my understanding; even beyond my fields of interest.
This extends beyond my academic studies, but also my hobbies, personal relationships, in addition to my very view on life.

My goal in life is simple: To be happy and bring happiness to others.

In addition to being a computer scientist, I am a musician. 
I am primarily a bass player and have played in 3 bands previously: an alternative band named 'Rice and Beans', an unnamed jazz band, and an alternative band named 'Phantom Language'.
I am currently band-less and have no plans to join a band, but I do enjoy playing and making music in my free time.

I have had a mohawk since I was around 8 years old. I've tried many colors but red is probably the most iconic one I'm remembered for.

In addition, I have 2 cats that I love very much. 
Their names are Honey and Luna.
I am very much a cat person, but I do love most animals. I especially like any type of feline (lions, pumas, etc.), any ape/monkey (gorilla, chimpanzee, orangutan, etc.), sharks, sloths, and penguins.

In my free time I enjoy practicing martial arts, playing/making music, listening to music, coding, playing board/tabletop/video games, and reading manga, manhwa, and books. I'm not much of a movie/show guy, but I will watch them occasionally.
Recently (Summer 2022) I finally saw all of the Star Wars movies and can definitively say that although I like both Star Wars and Star Trek... Star Trek is better.

Some of my favorite manga/anime are: 'Naruto Shippuden', 'Anohana', 'Rurouni Kenshin', 'Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO)', 'Mob Psycho 100', and 'Sweetness and Lightning'.

Some of my favorite books are: '1984' by George Orwell, 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell, 'The Time Machine' by H.G. Wells, 'The Illustrated Man' by Ray Bradbury, and 'Fahrenheit 451' by Ray Bradbury.

Some of my favorite video games are: Dishonored, Elden Ring, League of Legends, Civilation 6, Bloons Tower Defense 6, Resident Evil 2 (Remastered), and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
I like RPG's, JRPG's, and action games the best. For me nothing beats a great story and compelling gameplay alongside some strategy.

Some of my favorite music genres are: Alternative, Rock, Metal, Bluegrass, Reggaeton, 90's Rap, Orchestral (Western Classical), Electronic, Disco, Oldies, Crooner, Folk, Electronica, and KPOP.

Some of my favorite music artists/bands are: MUSE, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tool, Ghost, G-Idle, Blackpink, TWICE, Bad Bunny, Daddy Yankee, Guaynaa, Eminem, Handlez Mcgee, Kendrick Lamar, Tupac, K.A.A.N., ABBA, Audioslave, Metallica, Villagers of Ioannina City, and more.
