# My Personal Website

First and foremost, this website utilizes a template that can be found [here](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog?tab=readme-ov-file)

This website serves as a way for me to share my professional and personal interests.

This project utilizes a LOT of external libraries, API's, and so forth. For a more detailed explanation see this section _insert section_

## Navigation

### Landing Page

The landing page is essentially an elevator pitch about me and my abilities. It also contains my resume which is available for download.

### Blog

A blog that contains all of the blog posts I've written. These contain searchable and indexable tags. The contents discussed within these posts are my own and not reflective of others.

The blog posts themselves contain contents that may vary across disciplines, interests, and fields. I don't envision there being many external references or links to these contents, so I implore you to do some research about them to get a better understanding of the information and not just my opinion.

### Projects Page

Featured Projects, Current Projects, and Future projects are available to be viewed here. Not all of my projects will be listed however. Many of those are available for viewing within the repositories found on my profile.

Each Project has an associated image, description, languages, frameworks, and github repository link. Additional Information may be listed as well such as documentation, images, development progress updates, and links to collaborator profiles.

### About Page

The About page describes me and my interests in a more detailed manner than that of the landing page.

Contact Information is also available to stay connected with me across various social media platforms.

Accolades, Achievements, and Certifications will be the final contents available on this page. These include Data Science Certifications, Personal Achievements and Certifications. Some may have associated blog posts which will contain relevant links.

### Music Page

On this page, I go in detail about my musical interests, projects, and preferences.

I'm often asked of my favorite artists/songs/genres and so this page is a direct response to that. My preferences and tastes change over time so this is not a permanent change.

Dexed is a really cool tool I utilize to create music and highly recommend it.
